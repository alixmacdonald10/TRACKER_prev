Repo for thesis in collaboration with RHEA and ESA. The project aims to detect space debris using ground aquired space imagery.

The method utilises AI to pre-process images, detect objects and then return the object state vector which is then cross referenced against a database of known objects.

Most of the method is hidden due to an NDA however the investigation methods are shown.
